# leaky_pipes

## Description:
Recently I bought a new house,however there seems to be a small leakage problem with one of the taps, as water sips through the walls and the inner pipelines. I wonder if you could help me with this problem.

## Short write-up:
This is a very basic format strings based challenge. All we need to do is overwrite "bal" using format string vulnerability so that we may reach use_tapes() function, wherein the flag can be simply leaked.
