# theBet

## Description:
Welcome to the Bet! You are standing among the world's best lawyers, politicians and criminals. 
You approach a young lawyer not more than 24 years of age. As you converse with him, you come to know about his reputation. The next moment you know, you find yourself debating which is better - Capital Punishment or Life Imprisonment.
You are of the opinion that Capital Punishment is better as a quick death would mean less pain as compared to life of solitude in the cell. Your friend believes otherwise.
You both decide on writing down your views and handing them over to a third party, (a criminal) so as to decide who's opinion is correct.
The criminal however states that the one who loses the debate shall either face Capital Punishment or Life Imprisonment depending on what the winning party chooses. \n\nA politician gives you a lucky number, so if you win, you shall be given that amount of money, with which you may prosecute an execution or imprison him for life.
